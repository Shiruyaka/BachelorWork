2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
2 out of 133 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: start, init.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
2 out of 133 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: start, init.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Start_Driver_reg_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Start_Driver_reg_i_1/O, cell Start_Driver_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net enc/action_reg[0]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin enc/action_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell enc/action_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net enc/bits_reg[7]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin enc/bits_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell enc/bits_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net middle/__0/i__n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin middle/__0/i_/O, cell middle/__0/i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net middle/__1/i__n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin middle/__1/i_/O, cell middle/__1/i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net middle/init_state_reg_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin middle/init_state_reg_i_1/O, cell middle/init_state_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net middle/init_state_reg_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin middle/init_state_reg_i_2/O, cell middle/init_state_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net middle/mem_point_reg[31]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin middle/mem_point_reg[31]_i_2/O, cell middle/mem_point_reg[31]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net middle/nb_bits_int_reg[7]_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin middle/nb_bits_int_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell middle/nb_bits_int_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#10 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net middle/start_encoder_reg_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin middle/start_encoder_reg_i_1/O, cell middle/start_encoder_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
